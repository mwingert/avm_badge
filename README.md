# Badge Firmware

Firmware for the AVM badge, an ESP32-S3 device with a 6x13 no-diode GPIO
keyboard matrix, a 320x240 ST7789 SPI display, and a 4-LED SK6812 chain. It
runs on [AtomVM](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM), an Erlang/Elixir VM for
microcontrollers, and is written in Elixir.

## Requirements

- **Elixir and Erlang/OTP** — Elixir 1.13 or newer. There are many ways to
  install them; a version manager is the least painful, since it pins the
  pair per project:
  [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/lang/elixir.html) (`mise use erlang elixir`) or
  [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) (`asdf plugin add erlang && asdf plugin add
  elixir`) are both good choices
- **[`esptool`](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/)** — writes the
  base image, the assets partition and NVS
- **[`gh`](https://cli.github.com/)**, authenticated — `mix badge.base`
  downloads the VM release with it

On macOS:

    brew install esptool gh
    gh auth login

On Debian or Ubuntu:

    pipx install esptool      # or: pip install --user esptool
    # gh: https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md
    gh auth login

`esptool` also ships under its older name `esptool.py`; every tool here takes
either, falling back to `python3 -m esptool`. ESP-IDF is **not** needed to
build or flash the firmware — see [Advanced](#advanced) for the two things
that do want it.

## Getting started

Plug the badge in over USB, then:

    git clone https://github.com/protolux-electronics/avm_badge.git
    cd avm_badge/firmware
    mix deps.get
    mix badge.base             # once per board: bootloader, VM, boot.avm
    tools/flashassets.sh       # once per board: fonts, icons, splash logo
    mix atomvm.esp32.flash     # the firmware itself, every time

The serial port is auto-detected, so do not pass `--port`. It appears as
`/dev/cu.usbmodem*` on macOS and `/dev/ttyACM*` on Linux, and the path changes
between sessions because the board re-enumerates.

The board resets itself after each write, so chain the read onto the flash to
watch it boot (`stty -F` on Linux):

    ( mix atomvm.esp32.flash >/dev/null 2>&1; \
      stty -f /dev/cu.usbmodem* 115200 raw -echo; \
      timeout 25 cat /dev/cu.usbmodem* )

You should see the AtomVM banner, then `Badge: starting`, then the home grid
on the panel. The six shape keys open the pages; the arrows page the grid.

`tools/flashassets.sh` writes the assets partition, which holds the extra
fonts, the splash logo and the rickroll frames. It is **not** updated over the
air, so run it again whenever anything under `assets/` changes — see
[Assets](#assets). A badge without it still boots and prints
`Badge: no assets partition:`, it just skips the splash.

Reflashing leaves NVS alone, so the profile, the badges you have collected and
the wifi credentials all survive.

### Without a board

    iex -S mix     # the firmware against fake hardware, panel at
                   # http://localhost:3240
    mix test       # 1313 tests on the host
    mix sim.check  # renders every page once, no browser

## How it fits together

`Badge.start/0` opens the two SPI buses the board needs (panel and LED chain)
and starts a `Supervisor` with three children: `Badge.Screen` owns the AtomGL
display port and text buffer, `Badge.Keyboard` scans the matrix and dispatches
key events, and `Badge.Pixels` drives the LED chain and runs its idle
animation. See the moduledocs in `lib/badge/` for how each part works;
`lib/badge/hardware.ex` is the single source of truth for pin assignments.

## Testing

Pure modules (`Badge.TextBuffer`, `Badge.Keymap`, `Badge.Sharing`, the wire
formats) are tested on the host; anything that talks to GPIO, SPI or AtomGL is
verified on hardware instead. `mix test` needs no board.

## NervesHub (optional)

Over-the-air updates need a NervesHub device key. Export both:

    export BADGE_NH_KEY=...
    export BADGE_NH_SECRET=...

then run `tools/provision.py`, which merges them into the badge's NVS and
leaves every other key alone. The tools warn and continue when these are
unset; a badge without them simply never updates.

## Chat server

Badges talk to `wss://badge-chat.protolux.io` unless told otherwise. To point
one at a server on your bench:

    export AVM_BADGE_SERVER_URL=ws://192.168.1.50:4000
    tools/provision.py

Give a base only — scheme, host and optional port. The scheme picks the
transport: `wss://` verifies against the public certificate authorities built
into the image, so a Let's Encrypt certificate needs no work on the badge;
`ws://` runs in the clear, which is what makes a local server reachable without
certificates or a tunnel. `mix phx.server` in `avm_badge_server` already
listens on `0.0.0.0:4000`.

## App store

Pages can be installed without a cable from signed packs in
[mwingert/avm_badge_apps](https://github.com/mwingert/avm_badge_apps), through
the Store page. [doc/app-store.md](doc/app-store.md) covers creating,
building, publishing, browsing and installing apps.

## Flash layout

Partition table read back off the board (`esptool read_flash` +
`gen_esp32part.py`):

```
nvs         data  nvs      0x9000     24K
phy_init    data  phy      0xf000      4K
factory     app   factory  0x10000  1920K
boot.avm    data  phy      0x1f0000  544K
assets.avm  data  phy      0x278000  256K
main.avm    data  phy      0x2b8000  656K
alt.avm     data  phy      0x35c000  656K
```

This table is compiled into the AtomVM image. Changing it means a serial
reflash of every badge.

## Base image

The VM this firmware runs on is a fork of AtomVM, built and published by CI at
[protolux-electronics/AtomVM](https://github.com/protolux-electronics/AtomVM).
`BASE_IMAGE` names the release this firmware expects.

    mix badge.base            # bootloader, partition table, VM, boot.avm
    mix badge.base --vm-only  # just the VM and boot.avm

`boot.avm` holds the standard libraries the VM starts from. It is written
alongside the VM every time, because the two must come from the same build —
a VM with no matching `boot.avm` aborts at startup with `Invalid startup
avmpack` and reboots in a loop.

Both verify the download's SHA256 before flashing and raise on a mismatch.

## Assets

Sources live in `assets/src/`. To regenerate:

    tools/mkfonts.sh                    # assets/fonts/*.uf
    python3 tools/icons.py              # assets/icons/*.rgba
    python3 tools/gif.py                # assets/rickroll/*.rgba
    mix badge.assets                    # packs assets.avm
    tools/flashassets.sh                # writes it to the assets partition

`assets.avm` is not updated over the air.

## Advanced

Two jobs need [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/get-started/):
provisioning NVS, and changing the VM itself. Everything else above works
without it.

Install it once (v5.5 or newer, matching the fork's CI), then source its
environment in any shell that needs it:

    git clone -b v5.5 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git ~/esp/esp-idf
    ~/esp/esp-idf/install.sh esp32s3
    . ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh

### Provisioning NVS

`tools/provision.py` borrows two things from ESP-IDF: its NVS parser, to read
what the badge already holds, and its NVS image generator, to write the merged
result back. The generator lives inside ESP-IDF's own virtualenv rather than
on your `PATH`, which is why sourcing `export.sh` (or just setting `IDF_PATH`)
is enough — the tool finds the right interpreter itself.

    python3 tools/provision.py --wifi-ssid MyNetwork      # prompts for the passphrase
    python3 tools/provision.py --dry-run                  # read and show the merge
    python3 tools/provision.py --forget-wifi              # drop the saved network

Every value comes from the first of: the flag, the environment variable, the
badge. Anything you do not pass is read off the badge and written back
unchanged, so provisioning one key never loses the others.

### Changing the VM

The VM, its AtomGL display driver and the websocket component are built from
the fork at
[protolux-electronics/AtomVM](https://github.com/protolux-electronics/AtomVM).
Its `src/platforms/esp32/BADGE-BUILD.md` documents how to reproduce a badge
build, which CMake flags this board needs, and how the AtomGL and websocket
submodules fit in. The upstream
[AtomVM documentation](https://www.atomvm.net/doc/main/) covers the VM's own
build system, packbeam format and NIF interface.

Once built, flash the VM at `0x10000` and `boot.avm` at `0x1F0000`; both must
come from the same build. The application at `0x2B8000` survives.
